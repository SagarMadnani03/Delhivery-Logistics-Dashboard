Delhivery - Logistics Data Analysis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgABxVCBsE)

Steps:

1. Data Collection from kaggle:

import kagglehub

# Download latest version
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("devarajv88/delhivery-logistics-dataset")

print("Path to dataset files:", path)


2. Requirement Analysis: 

To find delay delivery and on time deliveries and present it in a dashboard:

(PWBI)
Delayed Shipments (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(delhivery, delhivery[is_cutoff] = FALSE)),
    [Total Shipments],
    0
) * 100


On-Time Deliveries (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(delhivery, delhivery[is_cutoff] = TRUE)),
    [Total Shipments],
    0
) * 100



3. Loading the data in Power Bi

4. Starting EDA by building some KPIs.

a. Total Shipments ---> DISTINCTCOUNT(shipments[uuid])

b. Average Delivery Time --> average of actual time

c. Delayed Shipments (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(delhivery, delhivery[is_cutoff] = FALSE)),
    [Total Shipments],
    0
) * 100


d. On-Time Deliveries (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(delhivery, delhivery[is_cutoff] = TRUE)),
    [Total Shipments],
    0
) * 100

e. is_cutoff(1=ontime, 0=delayed)

--------------------------------------------


Extract Day, Month and Year


Create calculated columns for Day of week and Hour of Day.



DAY_OF_WEEK =FORMAT(delhivery[cutoff_timestamp], "dddd")


HOUR_OF_DAY =HOUR(delhivery[cutoff_timestamp])

CutOff Compliance by Day and Time  ---> Matrix

Time and Distance charts:

Scatter plot comparing actual time vs osrm time

Scatter plot comparing actual distance vs osrm distance.

Histogram of start_to_end_scan to show processing time distribution.

Bar chart: Compare the number of trips by route type(Carting vs FTL).



OSRM -- Routing service based on OpenStreetMap data.

This package enables the computation of routes, trips, isochrones & travel dist matrices
